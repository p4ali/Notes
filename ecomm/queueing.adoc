== Queuing to avoid peak load surge

The idea is very similar to what you have in DMV:

* Guard will let you in once waiting room is (or close) empty
* Receptionist will issue you a ticket number
* You enter the waiting room and wait until your number is called
* During the period in waiting room, a staff may kick you out if you are not qualified to be served

During a campaign event - e.g., XBOX or PS5:

* Customer will be put into a bounded queue, and issue a ticket number
* Each customer will have a HMAC based on the number
* A cron job triggering the batch process for customers in waiting room
* When waiting room is (or close) empty, next customers from the queue will be moved to waiting room if he can be verified as a valid customer (instead of a bot)
