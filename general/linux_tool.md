## [ZFS](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/zfs.html)

ZFS has three major design goals:

* Data integrity: All data includes a checksum of the data.
* Pooled storage: physical storage devices are added to a pool, and storage space is allocated from that shared pool.which can be
                  increased by adding new storage devices to the pool.
* Performance: multiple caching mechanisms provide increased performance.
