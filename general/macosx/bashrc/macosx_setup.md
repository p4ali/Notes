## Iterm `Alt B/F` behavior

This require change the default option key behavior, i.e., to make it behave like a meta key, to do this:
* Go to Preferences->Profiles tab. Select your profile on the left, and then open the `Keys` tab. At the bottom is a set of buttons that lets you select the behavior of the Option key. For most users, `Esc+` will be the best choice

After that, you can use `alt+b` to move cursor back word-wise, and `alt+f` forward.
