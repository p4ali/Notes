## Gnu **make**

The `make` utility automatically determines which piece of a large program need to recompile and issue commands to recompile them.
You need have a M[m]akefile

`make` uses `makefile` database and last-modification times of the files to decide which of the files needs to be updated. For each
of those files, it issues the recipes recorded in the database.
### To run `make`
```bash
make
make -f {m,M}akefile
```

## Rule

```
target ... : prerequsites ...
<tab>        recipe
            ...
            ...
```

A `target` is usually the name of a file that is generated by a program; examples of targets are exe or object files. A `target` can
also be the name of an action to carry out, such as `clean` (Phony target)

A `recipe` is an action that `make` carries out. A recipe my have more than one command, can be multple line. You **MUST** put a `tab`
character at the beginning of every recipe.
You can set **.RECIPEPREFIX** variable to an alternatie charctor other than `tab`.

A `rule` explains how and when to remake certain files which are the targets of the particular fule.

## .DEFAULT_GOAL

By default, the first target (not targets whose name start with '.' and not followed with '/'). But you can set by .DEFAULT_GOAL:

```
.DEFAULT_GOAL: foo

foo: 
    recipe
```
