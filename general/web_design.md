From [Gabriel Manricks](http://www.amazon.com/Gabriel-Manricks/e/B00J2Z815U/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_pop_1) in his [Instance JavaScript Framework Starter](http://www.amazon.com/Instant-Meteor-JavaScript-Framework-Starter-ebook/dp/B00CITNQHK), I like the **Planning process** from concetp to completion.

The process consists of make up five simple plans each tackling different area of difficulty:
* **The Feature plan** - user story (simpler than use case), such as "ablility to signup/login"
* **The Data plan** - this is NOT db plan nor variables plan. This is about what pieces of info we need to to create 
    description from the feature plan.
* **The Object plan** - group the component to object. (some books put this step before the previous step)
* **The Page plan** - draw different pages with different tools (not html/css)
* **The Reconciliation plan** - based on all previous plans, define interfaces between each other.
* Iterate

Most modern company however took a approach which is similar:
* UX user research
* UX write user story
* UX/dev IPM ([Integrated Project Management](http://www.amazon.com/Integrated-Project-Management-Bruce-Barkley/dp/0071466266)) to gether developers opinion, vote points
* Dev implementation
* Iterate
