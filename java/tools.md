## [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/usage)

sdkman can be used to manage local jdk and others like rbenv, nvm, etc.

Configure files:
* ~/.sdkman/etc/config - global settings
* ./sdkman - project specific sdk setting, e.g., which version jdk is used for current project. Use `sdk env` to switch to local setting
