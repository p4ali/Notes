## **this**

You can figure out what object **this** refers to by following a few simple rules:

* By default, **this** refers to the global object.
* When a function is called as a property on a parent object, **this** refers to the parent object inside that function.
* When a function is called with the new operator, **this** refers to the newly created object inside that function.
* When a function is called using call or apply, **this** refers to the first argument passed to call or apply. 
  If the first argument is null or not an object, **this** refers to the global object.

If you understand and follow those four rules, you will always know what **this** is.
